# Open CV

The openCV files were not included in the github repository.
Currently I am using openCV 4.5.5 (see in the build.gradle file).

To be able to compile everything, download openCV, and merge the sdk folder with this sdk folder (while keeping build.gradle)
You also have to add the elements in native/jni folder in a jniLibs folder in app/src/jniLibs.
If not working, look at [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psoeNfFAKL8) that I used.
Good luck if it does not work^^
